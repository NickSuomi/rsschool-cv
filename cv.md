* ## About myself
After my education in France and a few years of work as a chemical engineer I realized - chemistry isn't exactly what I want.  At that point, I started looking for any available information about programming and the Computer Science world overall.
After a year of self-education, I applied for an EPAM internship but didn't pass an interview. 
Thanks to my interviewer I found out about RS-School.
